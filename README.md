# donut_tychoon_flask
After 2 days to learn Python and Flask, I built my first full-stack CRUD app with these new tools!

## To start this app


## Requirements
* Run server
* Create templates to render views
* Create database
* Create tables in database
* Seed database/tables
* Build routes to query database
* Create forms to edit records
* Create forms to add new records
* Create option for user to delete a record
* Attach a style sheet (no need for advanced styling)
